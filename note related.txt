about useMemo and useEffect
-useMemo is used when functions or something that not to do everytime component's re-render. just do when require.
import { useState, useMemo } from "react";
    function expensive() {
        console.log("Some expensive tasks");
        return "data";
        }
        function App() {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
        const data = useMemo(() => {
        return expensive();
        }, []);
        return 
            <div>
                <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
                <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
                Button
                </button>
            </div>;
    }

In the above code expensive function is just run only one time, and changing data in dependencies array [] can run next time. that is called useMemo function.
